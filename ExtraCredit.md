# ITP/IMA Show: A Glimpse into the Future of Wearables

The ITP/IMA show on December 17th unveiled a remarkable array of innovative projects, but two wearable pieces, in particular, caught my eye: the "Heart Infinity Mirror" by Andres Franco and "Gestura" by Hanyong Yang, Junhao Ren, Kefan Lyu, and Muqing Wang. These creations are not only feats of engineering and design but also powerful statements on the integration of technology with personal expression and accessibility.

## Heart Infinity Mirror

Andres Franco's "Heart Infinity Mirror" is an interactive wearable that reimagines the concept of a necklace. This heart-shaped piece is more than just a fashion statement; it's a dynamic sculpture that responds to movement with ever-changing light patterns. The construction is meticulous—a wooden frame houses a mirror, 66 LEDs, and a half-mirror, creating the illusion of an endless tunnel of light.

**Conversation with the Artist**:

Talking to Andres, I discovered that the piece was inspired by the desire to capture the essence of emotion and movement in a tangible form. Each LED pattern shift symbolizes a heartbeat, a moment of life responding to the wearer and their environment. This piece stood out as a beacon of personal expression, reflecting not just light but the vitality of the human spirit.

"Gestura" is a revolutionary wearable device that extends the language of performance to artists with cerebral palsy and speech limitations. It's a testament to inclusivity, enabling expression through gesture. The technology interprets upper limb movements and translates them into real-time auditory and visual outputs on stage.

**Conversation with the Artists**:

In my dialogue with the creators, I learned that "Gestura" was born from a profound respect for the performing arts and a dedication to empowering artists of all abilities. The team's passion for creating an accessible artistic medium was palpable. Their device doesn't just break down barriers; it dismantles them, offering a new vocabulary of artistic expression.

**Analysis Using the Design Framework for Social Wearables**:

Analyzing "Gestura" through the lens of the Design Framework for Social Wearables, we see a clear emphasis on **sensing-actuating interplay**. The device's sensors accurately pick up on the performer's intended gestures, while the output—transforming these movements into sound and visuals—acts as the actuation.

The **personal and social requirements** of the wearable are profound. "Gestura" respects the individual's need for a personalized method of expression while acknowledging the collective experience of communication and performance. It addresses the **social acceptability** by seamlessly fitting into the context of performing arts, enhancing rather than distracting from the artistic narrative.

In conclusion, the ITP/IMA show was a showcase of creativity and technological innovation, with "Heart Infinity Mirror" and "Gestura" standing out as embodiments of what wearables can achieve. They are not only products of their creators' ingenuity but also platforms that redefine interaction and accessibility.
