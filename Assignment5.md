# Grommet, Rivet, Snaps

## Title: Exploring Grommets, Rivets, and Snaps: A Complete Sampler

### Introduction:
In this blog post, we will embark on a journey to explore three essential fastening tools: Grommets, Rivets, and Snaps. I will set up a sampler that includes two grommets of different sizes, two rivets of different heights, and two snaps. Along the way, I will share how to set these fasteners and document our learning process, highlighting what I've discovered and any questions that arise.

**Grommets:**

![Grommet_1](https://github.com/basil-ahmed/Wearables/assets/90772853/1ce25ee7-0262-43ac-9054-57d87bd0db40)

**Setting Grommets:**
To begin, let's set up our sampler with two grommets of different sizes. Here's how you can set grommets:

1. Place the grommet (the top hat piece) on your fabric where you want to attach it.

2. Trace the inner ring of the grommet onto the fabric. This will give you the correct size for your hole.

3. Start by cutting a smaller hole than you need. You can always adjust it later if necessary. Remember that if the hole is too big, the grommet may not hold securely.

4. Now, insert the grommet components into the hole. One side should have a shorter post, and the other side should have a longer one.

5. Place the longer post underneath the fabric and align the shorter post on top.

6. Use a grommet setter tool or a mallet to firmly press the two posts together. This action will flatten the grommet and secure it in place.

**What I Learned:**
Setting grommets can be straightforward if you take the time to measure and cut the hole precisely. It's crucial to start with a smaller hole and adjust as needed to ensure a snug fit. The grommet setter tool is essential for a clean and secure attachment.

**Questions I Have:**
- Are there different types of grommets for specific materials?
- What are some creative ways to use grommets in projects?

**Rivets:**

**Setting Rivets:**
Next, let's explore rivets by including two of different heights in our sampler. Here's how to set rivets:

1. Make sure you have a rivet anvil, a rivet setter, and a hammer.

2. Insert the shorter side of the rivet through the hole in your fabric, from the front to the back.

3. Place the rivet anvil on a sturdy surface and position the fabric with the rivet on top of it.

4. Insert the longer side of the rivet onto the anvil.

5. Use the rivet setter and hammer to strike the exposed end of the rivet. This action will flatten the rivet on the backside of the fabric.

6. Repeat the process for the second rivet.

**What I Learned:**
Setting rivets is a quick and effective way to secure two pieces of fabric together. The rivet anvil ensures stability, and the rivet setter tool simplifies the process.

**Questions I Have:**
- Can rivets be used for different materials other than fabric?
- What are some decorative rivet designs available?

**Snaps:**

**Setting Snaps:**
Finally, let's add two snaps to our sampler. Here's how to set snaps:

1. Align the two sides of the snap on opposite sides of the fabric where you want them to connect.

2. Use a snap setting tool to press down firmly on the snap components. This action will secure the snap in place.

3. Repeat the process for the second snap.

**What I Learned:**
Snaps are a convenient way to fasten fabric pieces together. They are easy to install and provide a secure closure for various projects.

**Questions I Have:**
- Are there different types of snaps for different purposes?
- Can snaps be easily replaced if they wear out?

### Conclusion:
Setting up this complete sampler with grommets, rivets, and snaps has been an enlightening experience. I've learned the basic techniques for each fastening tool and discovered their practical applications. Additionally, I've raised some intriguing questions that could lead to further exploration in the world of fabric fasteners. Whether you're a seasoned crafter or a beginner, these versatile tools can enhance your sewing and crafting projects, adding both functionality and style.

# New Textile Swatch: Material and Texture Exploration

## Title: Crafting a Unique Textile: Exploring the Hot Glue Gun

### Introduction:
In this Blog, we delve into the fascinating world of textile creation using a hot glue gun. This unconventional tool offers an exciting avenue for crafting textures and surfaces that are both visually intriguing and tactilely stimulating. Join me as I document the process, successes, challenges, and choices made during the creation of this new textile.

**Creating the Textile:**

To create this new textile, I embarked on a journey with a hot glue gun in hand. Here's how I brought my textile to life:

1. **Material Selection:** I started by selecting a base material to apply the hot glue onto. I chose a sturdy, non-absorbent fabric (Parchment Paper) as my canvas, as it would allow me to manipulate the hot glue effectively.

2. **Design Concept:** I envisioned a textile that would evoke a sense of organic growth and texture. Inspired by natural forms, I decided to create an abstract pattern resembling intertwined vines and branches.

3. **Glue Application:** Using the hot glue gun, I carefully applied the hot glue in a free-flowing manner, allowing it to form sinuous lines and intricate patterns on the fabric. I experimented with different pressure levels to control the thickness of the glue lines.

4. **Color Choices:** While the hot glue itself is clear, I decided to introduce colors by using colored glue sticks. These colors were inspired by the vibrant hues of nature, such as earthy browns, leafy greens, and a touch of floral red.

![new_2](https://github.com/basil-ahmed/Wearables/assets/90772853/e02203da-f6ee-4118-960b-b94e28a613d7)

**Successful Elements:**

- The process of using the hot glue gun allowed me to create intricate and unique patterns with ease.
- The choice of non-absorbent fabric as a base material ensured that the glue adhered well and maintained its three-dimensional texture.
- Experimenting with different pressure levels while applying the glue provided a dynamic range of texture within the textile.

**Challenges and Questions:**

- Maintaining a consistent flow of hot glue proved challenging, as the gun tends to release glue even after releasing the trigger. This required careful control and a steady hand.
- I wonder if there are alternative methods or tools to achieve even more complex textures with hot glue.
- How would the textile react over time, especially in terms of durability and flexibility?

**Influences on Choices:**

The choice of colors and the organic shapes I created were influenced by my fascination with the natural world. I aimed to capture the beauty of tangled vines, intertwining branches, and the rich, earthy colors found in forests and gardens.

**Tactile Experience:**

The tactile experience of this new textile is both intriguing and unique. Running my fingers across the hot glue lines feels like tracing the contours of nature itself. When placed on different areas of my body, it elicits sensations reminiscent of running one's fingers through tangled vines or feeling the ridges of tree bark.

**Outcome and Expectations:**

The outcome of this exercise exceeded my expectations. The hot glue textile successfully captured the essence of organic growth and provided a tactile experience that resonated with the natural world. It was a delightful surprise to see how the colors and patterns came together to create something truly unique.

**Thoughts and Feelings:**

During this creative process, I found myself immersed in a sense of wonder and connection to nature. The tactile associations that arose while exploring the texture reminded me of the beauty and complexity of the world around us. These feelings of awe and inspiration undoubtedly influenced the choices I made in creating this textile.

In conclusion, the hot glue gun has proven to be a versatile tool for crafting captivating textures and textiles. This project has expanded my creative horizons, and I look forward to exploring further possibilities with this unconventional medium in future artistic endeavors.
