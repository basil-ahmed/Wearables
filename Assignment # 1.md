### Think about how you exist in the world today.  Consider the various settings you enter and how those environments and people have had an impact on your presentation.  

In my case, I use specific head and face adornments to convey my intentions and preferences:

### 1. Communication Using Head and Face Adornments:

**Airpods:** I wear Airpods when I'm not in the mood to talk or when I want to signal to others that I'm engaged in listening to audio content or taking a phone call. This serves as a non-verbal cue to discourage interaction or conversation.
**Glasses:** I wear glasses to correct my vision, which is a functional necessity. While glasses are primarily for vision correction, they can also be seen as a personal style choice and a form of self-expression.

### 2. Items Worn in Specific Settings:

**Airpods:** I wear Airpods in various settings where I anticipate the need to focus on audio content, such as during a commute, at the gym, or while working in a noisy environment. They are especially useful in public spaces.
**Glasses:** I wear glasses whenever I need to see clearly, which is essentially in all settings where I require visual clarity, such as at class/work, at home, while driving, or during recreational activities.

### 3. Communication to the Masses vs. Individuals:

**Airpods:** Wearing Airpods primarily communicates to individuals around me. It signals to those in close proximity that I'm engaged with audio and not readily available for conversation. While it may affect people around me individually, it's not intended for a broad audience.
**Glasses:** Glasses serve both functional and aesthetic purposes and communicate to both individuals and the masses. They help me see clearly, which is important in all situations, and they can also convey personal style or identity to a broader audience.


In summary, my use of Airpods and glasses demonstrates how specific head and face adornments can serve practical and communicative purposes in various settings. Airpods are a way of communicating my desire for solitude or audio engagement to individuals nearby, while glasses are functional items that also express my personal style and identity to a wider audience.

### 4. How do you communicate using gestures/movement involving the head, neck, and face?

I use a range of non-verbal cues involving your head, neck, and face to communicate in different contexts:

### 5. What are those gestures?

**Nodding:** I nod my head up and down to indicate agreement or affirmation (yes) or to signal disagreement or negation (no).
**Greeting with Head:** When passing by someone on the street or at university, I use a nod or slight tilt of my head as a friendly greeting or acknowledgment.
**Listening:** I maintain eye contact, nod, and occasionally tilt my head slightly to show that I am actively listening and engaged in the conversation.
**Facial Expressions:** I use a variety of facial expressions such as smiling, frowning, raising an eyebrow, or furrowing my brow to convey my emotional state and reactions.

### 6. What are you communicating?

**Nodding:** Nodding communicates agreement or acknowledgment when used in response to questions or statements. Conversely, shaking your head communicates disagreement or refusal.
**Greeting with Head:** When I nod or smile at someone, I'm conveying politeness, recognition, and a friendly disposition. It's a non-verbal way to say, "Hello, I see you," without verbalizing it.
**Listening:** By nodding and maintaining eye contact, I signal to the speaker that I am actively paying attention and processing their words. It conveys my interest and engagement in the conversation.
**Facial Expressions:** My facial expressions convey my emotions and reactions to the situation or conversation. For example, a smile communicates happiness or agreement, while a furrowed brow may indicate confusion or concern.

### 7. Who are you speaking to?

**Nodding:** I am communicating primarily with the person I am interacting with, responding to their questions or statements.
**Greeting with Head:** This gesture is typically directed at anyone I pass by on the street or encounter at university. It's a general gesture of acknowledgment towards individuals in my immediate vicinity.
**Listening:** I am communicating my engagement and attentiveness to the person I am conversing with.
**Facial Expressions:** My facial expressions communicate to anyone observing me, but they are most directly relevant to the person I am interacting with, as they provide insight into my emotional state and reactions during the conversation.


In summary, my use of head, neck, and facial gestures serves as a vital form of non-verbal communication, conveying agreement, acknowledgment, politeness, engagement, and emotional reactions in various social contexts with both individuals and the broader public.


### 1. What might you be communicating that you were not aware of?

**Colors:** My choice of brighter colors when I'm in a good mood and dull colors when I'm in a bad mood can unintentionally convey my emotional state to those around me. People may subconsciously pick up on these cues and make assumptions about my mood.
**Textures:** Wearing hoodies when I'm not feeling very energetic or active and opting for a nice shirt when I'm motivated can unknowingly communicate my energy level and enthusiasm to others.

### 2. What adornments and/or gestures were intentional?

**Formal vs. Casual Attire:** Choosing to wear button-down shirts or suits to formal events and casual clothes when hanging out is an intentional choice. It signifies my adherence to dress codes and my respect for the formality of the occasion.
**Color Choices:** While I may unintentionally convey my mood through color choices, selecting specific colors for formal events or casual outings can be intentional. For example, I may deliberately wear more subdued or muted colors for formal events to convey professionalism.

### 3. What was unintentional?

**Mood-Related Colors:** My tendency to select brighter or duller colors based on my mood is unintentional. It's a subconscious expression of how I feel on a particular day, which others may pick up on without me explicitly stating my emotions.
**Texture Choices:** Wearing hoodies for comfort and relaxation or choosing a nice t-shirt to feel motivated is often unintentional. I may gravitate towards these textures and styles based on comfort and habit rather than a conscious decision to convey a specific message.

In summary, my clothing choices exhibit a blend of intentional and unintentional communication. While I intentionally select formal or casual attire based on the occasion and may consciously choose colors for specific effects, my mood-related color choices and texture preferences often convey messages without me being fully aware of it. These non-verbal cues can influence how others perceive my mood and energy level.
