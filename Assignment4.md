## Findings with my Partner about the color Yellow and Garment District

**Commonalities:**

1. **Yellow:** Both I and my partner associated the color yellow with similar concepts - sunshine, happiness, and warmth. This shared theme suggests that yellow could be a central element in our creative projects, serving as a symbol of positivity and cheerfulness.

2. **Lemonade and Citrus:** The mention of lemonade, lemons, and bananas brings a refreshing and citrusy aspect to our associations. These references might inspire us to explore citrus-inspired color palettes or even incorporate fruit-themed designs into our fashion pieces, especially if we're aiming for a summery, vibrant feel.

3. **Rain:** Rain, raincoats, and rain boots emerged as shared associations. This could indicate a mutual interest in incorporating rainy or water-related themes into our designs. Rainy-day fashion can be both functional and stylish, offering an interesting avenue for creativity.

4. **Construction Workers:** The observation of construction workers and safety vests suggests a potential interest in utilitarian or high-visibility fashion elements. We might explore designs influenced by workwear aesthetics or safety gear, combining functionality with fashion.

5. **Surprise and Royalty:** Both partners noted an intriguing surprise regarding the restrictions on wearing Yellow in China by anyone other than the royal family. Additionally, the associations of purple and red with royalty open up discussions about how different was it in China that the color Yellow was chosen as the Royal Color. We could explore the use of regal colors and traditional Chinese motifs in your designs, incorporating cultural elements into your work.

6. **Taxi Cabs:** The mention of taxi cabs lead to discussions about incorporating the iconic yellow taxi color into our designs, experimenting with checker patterns, or drawing inspiration from taxi culture for a retro-themed fashion line.

**Differences/Interesting Points:**

1. **Yellow Aversion:** Shannon mentioned not liking the color yellow. According to her, the only reason for not liking is that she thinks it doesn't look good on her. This presents an interesting challenge and opportunity. We might consider how to incorporate yellow elements in ways that are visually appealing to both of us. It could involve using yellow as an accent color or in combination with other colors that balance out the aversion.

2. **Texture and Fabric Store Experiences:** Our experiences at fabric stores differed slightly. While both of us felt overwhelmed, she actively sought out swatchers, indicating a preference for a hands-on approach. On the other hand, I was surprised by specific practices at certain stores, like B&J putting stickers on swatches. These differences in approach and observations can contribute to a well-rounded creative process, combining different perspectives and ways of interacting with materials.

3. **Price Variability:** The range of fabric prices at different stores, ranging from $9 to $13 in the small family-owned store, and ranging from $22 to $45 in big stores like B&J, is an essential consideration for our budget and fabric selection. It's crucial to be aware of these price variations to make informed decisions when sourcing materials for your projects. This knowledge allows us to balance the desired quality and cost-effectiveness in your designs.

4. **Favorite Fabric Stores:** Each of us had their favorite fabric store based on their experiences. Mine was B&J for how organized it was and hers was Mood Fabrics for how much the variety of the fabrics was. It might also be worth considering if combining elements from both stores can create a unique blend of textures and materials for your fashion pieces.

In summary, our discussion revealed shared themes and diverse perspectives that can enrich our collaborative creative process.


## Accessibility Review and Questions

In this step, I will be reviewing and addressing accessibility issues in my presentation. Here are the actions I will take and the questions that arise during this process:

**Accessibility Review Actions:**

1. **Slide Reading Order:** I checked the reading order of my presentation slides to ensure that they make sense when read by screen readers. Reordering slides or adjusting the layout may be necessary to improve accessibility.

2. **Alt Text for Images:** I confirmed that all images used in my presentation have appropriate alt text. Alt text should describe the content or purpose of each image for individuals using screen readers.

3. **Color Contrast:** I examined the color contrast of text against background colors to ensure readability. Adjustments might be needed to meet accessibility standards.

4. **Links Descriptiveness:** I reviewed links within my slides to ensure they are presented descriptively. Instead of using long URLs, I will consider using more informative anchor text.

**Questions Arising:**

1. How can I ensure that the reading order of my slides is logical and understandable for screen reader users?

2. What are some strategies for creating informative and concise alt text for images, especially when they contain complex information?

3. Are there tools or resources available (other than Grackle) to check color contrast and ensure that my text is easily readable for individuals with visual impairments?

4. How can I strike a balance between creating an aesthetically pleasing presentation and ensuring it is fully accessible to everyone?

I understand that this accessibility review is not the primary focus of my wearables class, but I recognize the importance of considering how others may interact with my content. Ensuring accessibility is a way to make my work more inclusive and usable for a wider audience.
