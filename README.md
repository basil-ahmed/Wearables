### 1) NYU Digital Accessibility

Before delving into the digital accessibility resources available at NYU, I had some prior knowledge and considerations about the topic.

Firstly, I was well aware of the paramount importance of digital accessibility in ensuring that online content and platforms are usable by individuals with disabilities. This encompasses a range of elements, including but not limited to screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and the significance of providing alternative text for images.

Following a 1.5-hour exploration of NYU's resources on digital accessibility, I discovered several valuable links and materials that I intend to integrate into my work. These resources encompass:

**NYU Accessibility Guidelines:** NYU has established a set of tailored accessibility guidelines that provide clear and practical recommendations for creating inclusive digital content. These guidelines cover a wide range of digital assets, including websites, documents, and multimedia presentations. They serve as a foundational resource for ensuring that all digital content produced within the university is accessible and aligned with NYU's specific context.

**Training and Workshops:** NYU offers a diverse array of training sessions and workshops focused on digital accessibility. These sessions cater to various skill levels and encompass a wide range of topics. Participants can gain expertise in creating accessible documents, designing websites with accessibility in mind, and making multimedia content, such as videos and presentations, more inclusive. These training opportunities not only enhance understanding of accessibility principles but also provide practical skills for implementation.

**Accessibility Testing Tools:** NYU provides access to a suite of powerful accessibility testing tools and software applications. These tools enable comprehensive evaluations of digital content, including websites, documents, and multimedia elements. They pinpoint specific areas that may require improvement to meet or exceed established accessibility standards, such as WCAG. Access to these testing resources ensures that digital content within NYU adheres to accessibility requirements.

**Community and Support Groups:** NYU nurtures a vibrant community of individuals passionate about digital accessibility. Joining these communities and support groups offers opportunities for networking, knowledge sharing, and seeking guidance from experienced accessibility experts. Engagement with these communities allows individuals to stay informed about the latest accessibility trends and exchange ideas with peers who share a commitment to accessibility.

**Documentation and Resources Repository:** NYU maintains an extensive repository of documentation and resources dedicated to digital accessibility. This repository houses a wealth of articles, guides, checklists, and templates that individuals can use as references and tools to support their efforts in ensuring digital accessibility. This centralized resource hub simplifies the process of finding relevant information and materials to advance accessibility initiatives.

**Accessibility Coordinators:** NYU employs dedicated accessibility coordinators or specialists who provide personalized guidance and support. These experts are available to address questions, offer tailored advice, and collaborate with individuals and departments to ensure digital content complies with accessibility standards. The presence of accessibility coordinators underscores NYU's commitment to accessibility and facilitates a proactive approach to addressing accessibility challenges.

In conclusion, NYU's commitment to digital accessibility is evident through its multifaceted array of resources and support mechanisms. These resources cater to individuals with varying levels of expertise and encompass a broad spectrum of digital content, reinforcing the university's dedication to fostering an inclusive online environment. Whether you are a student, faculty member, or staff, NYU equips its community with the tools and knowledge necessary to champion digital accessibility.
